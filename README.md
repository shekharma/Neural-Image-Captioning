# Image Captioning with Seq-to-Seq Model

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a sequence-to-sequence (seq-to-seq) model to generate descriptive captions for images using the Flickr8K dataset. 

## Description
The model architecture involves:
- Using a pre-trained ResNet model as the Encoder to extract features from images.
- Utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks as the Decoder to generate captions.
- Implementing an Alignment Attention mechanism to focus on the most relevant pixels of the image at each step of caption generation.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Download and preprocess the Flickr8K dataset. This involves pairing images with their corresponding captions.
   
2. **Model Training**: Train the seq-to-seq model using the prepared dataset. This includes:
   - Encoding images with the pre-trained ResNet model.
   - Training the LSTM decoder to generate captions based on the encoded image features.
   - Implementing the Alignment Attention mechanism during training to improve caption quality.
   
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as BLEU score. This provides a quantitative measure of how well the generated captions match the reference captions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11
- Pytorch
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing and evaluation metrics
- Pre-trained ResNet model (can be obtained from torchvision or other sources)
- Flickr8K dataset (or any other dataset suitable for image captioning)

## Results
- The model's performance can be assessed based on the BLEU score, which measures the similarity between the generated captions and the reference captions in the dataset.
- Additionally, qualitative evaluation by human annotators can provide insights into the quality and fluency of the generated captions.
